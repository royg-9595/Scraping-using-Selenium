# Scraping-using-Selenium

This was pre-assignment given by Primenumbers Technologies for Internship

Dependicies:-
1.I used Jupyter Notebook for running python code blocks. So You need to pip jupyter notebook library. You can use IDE of your choice.
2.Pip install selenium. for scraping dynamic web pages.
3. Download chrome web browser if you dont have.
4. Download chrome drivers from the following link:- https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
5. Thats enough you are good to go!


Note:-

During the execution, chrome will pop up automatically. Don't worry it's a part of program. It will run throughout the program.
We can modify the code by not using the chrome to run on desktop too. So that we can save time by excluding css and unnecessary stuff.
